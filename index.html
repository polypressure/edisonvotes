                    Mrs Oberhardt’s appeal process is still very much alive,
                    and the LSC election on April 13th will play a crucial
                    role in determining her future at Edison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Mrs Oberhardt wins her appeal, she will likely return to
                    Edison on a short-term contract, perhaps as short as six
                    months, after which she will face another LSC renewal vote.

                  <p>
                    The canidates chosen during this election to serve in the
                    LSC will decide whether or not to renew her contract if
                    she does win her appeal.

                  Hello, my name is Ernesto Pérez and, along with my wife,
                  Maria, we are the parents of Sebastian, a second grader here
                  at Edison. I have lived in Chicago for most of my life and
                  have always appreciated the diversity among the people who
                  live here, not only in terms of ethnicity but also in the
                  wide range of social, economic and cultural differences. I
                  believe that when a person experiences a wider range of
                  beliefs and practices, especially those that challenge one’s
                  own, that it not only benefits that individual, but the
                  community as a whole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Professionally, my background is in art, design and
                  technology, having worked in various fields including
                  Editorial Design, Web Consulting, Video Game Development and
                  Teaching at the university level. During these experiences I
                  have been in both leadership and supporting roles, working
                  with groups that were physically in the same spaces as well
                  as contributors who were located elsewhere, sometimes on the
                  other side of the World. As a result of my past experiences I
                  am a proponent of art, both visual and performance, as part
                  of a well-rounded education and embrace technology not just
                  as a tool for learning but also as a way to enable better
                  communication. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As a member of the LSC I hope to promote transparency in not
                  just the process of improving the school but also within the
                  community itself. I welcome all opinions, suggestions and
                  views and will work to find ways to best address the concerns
                  of the school as a whole while trying to create an
                  environment of open discussion. Technology can be harnessed
                  to bring people together and, in the case of Edison, I will
                  strive to use it to allow those who may not have the time to
                  fully engage in the community to have more of a voice. It is
                  obvious that the last couple of months have been challenging
                  to the school community and I hope to not only help find
                  solutions to the issues at hand, but also assist in
                  developing an atmosphere where grievances can be aired and
                  dealt with in a healthy manner. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Looking forward to serving our community, I thank you in advanced for your support.

                    My name is Jim Magas. My daughter Stella is currently
                    enrolled as a 3rd-grader at Edison. I am a Michigan native
                    and Chicago resident since 1995. Our family resides in the
                    Portage Park neighborhood. I’ve been involved in many
                    facets of the music industry for over 20 years, primarily
                    in retail. I’ve been involved in community-building, large
                    event planning and global marketing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am humbly asking for the opportunity to represent you as
                    a member of the Edison Regional Gifted Center Local School
                    Council. Since our daughter Stella began attending
                    kindergarten in 2012, we’ve felt a strong sense of
                    gratitude and honor to attend such an esteemed school. It
                    is really a dream come true. We love the convivial
                    atmosphere, dedicated staff, accomplished student body and
                    visionary administration. Serving on the Local School
                    Council is a way to give back to the school that has
                    provided so much for us. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s no secret that our school has seen its share of recent
                    controversy. There will be disagreements and challenges
                    ahead, but we all share the common goal of wanting what is
                    best for our children and our school. Our diverse and
                    intelligent community is made up of many voices and they
                    all need to be heard. Through respectful discussion and
                    healthy debate, we can all become wiser as we move forward. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an elected member of the Local School Council, I will
                    respectfully listen to everyone. The LSC serves to
                    represent all parents. It will be my responsibility, as
                    your representative, to ensure that the LSC is transparent
                    and accountable to the student body, parents, faculty and
                    community. I am familiar with the challenges that working
                    families face to be more involved and I will seek new ways
                    to engage the community.

                    It will be my pleasure to serve you. Thank you for your consideration.

                    employed musician (Duchamp, Rearrangement and See Saw) and
                    cabinetmaker. I have been a home owner since 2003 with
                    rental income property for several years. I have been doing
                    my own taxes for 40 years. My skills can be of benefit to
                    the PTO.

                  <p>
                    I will advocate for the fee to join the PTO to be “pay what
                    you can” – I would like as many of the parents, staff and
                    teachers to be members of the PTO as possible. I also hope
                    to encourage more “Teachers” in the Parents and Teachers 
                    Organization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I will advocate for eliminating the competition between
                    grades during Track-a-Thon.  Some grades have families more
                    able to contribute than others. I do not feel we should
                    compete with each other. I believe we can strive for a
                    common goal instead to which everyone can contribute
                    according to their means.

                  <p>
                    I will advocate for being able to vote in the PTO elections
                    the same day one becomes a member regardless of when that
                    is. Currently one must be a member for thirty days in order
                    to vote. I see no reason for this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I will suggest that we send annual statements of
                    contributions to our members for tax purposes along with
                    statements showing where the money goes.

                    Our objectives as the PTO are to promote the education of

                  I'm the father of a first-grader, and I'll work to represent
                  the views and needs of families in Edison's lower grades. My
                  daughter has a condition requiring a 504 plan, so I'm
                  committed to advocating for kids with special needs. And
                  we’re a Spanish-speaking family, so I'll make sure the LSC's
                  decisions reflect the full diversity of Edison’s student
                  body.

                  As a reporter — for the Guardian, for Newsweek, and recently
                  as US correspondent for the Ecologist — I've covered a wide
                  range of educational and local-government issues, including a
                  stint on a team investigating disciplinary issues in New York
                  public schools, and several months reporting on gangs in a
                  Bronx high school. I've spent my career holding people and
                  organizations accountable, and I'll use my experience to
                  ensure the LSC does its job well, and to keep Edison on track
                  under its new leadership.

                  <p>
                  I've also spent time working in classrooms: during my college
                  years I served as a classroom aide and ESL teacher in schools
                  in the UK, Spain and Hong Kong, and spent a year as a
                  special-ed assistant for a 7-year-old boy with autism.  I’ve
                  seen many different school systems, both functional and
                  dysfunctional, and my breadth of experience will be a boon to
                  the LSC.

                  <p>
                  As you'd expect from a journalist, I'm passionate about
                  engagement and transparency, and I'm determined to make the
                  LSC more proactive about communicating with and seeking
                  feedback from parents and teachers. I'll make it a priority
                  to keep Edison's very, very busy parents up to speed on LSC
                  activities, and to find new ways to help everyone stay
                  informed and involved.

                  Edison is on the brink of its biggest shakeup in years, and
                  it's vital that we move beyond the tension surrounding Mrs
                  Oberhardt's departure. If elected, I'll work to make the LSC
                  an open, inclusive and positive space where all Edison
                  families can come together and have a voice in the way the
                  school is run.  I firmly believe that we're all on the same
                  team, and that it's by working together that we can best
                  ensure a bright future — for Edison, and for all our
                  children.

                    The day I learned my son, 1st grader Jay, was admitted to
                    Edison, I had been watching out our front window to see
                    when the mail truck would arrive. As soon as it pulled up,
                    I ran out to see if that all important CPS letter had been
                    delivered. It had, and as I read the words about my boy's
                    acceptance to ERGC, I screamed in joy and jumped up and
                    down in the middle of the street, hugging our mail carrier,
                    and tried to explain my giddiness.

                  <p>
                    I hope to never lose that sense of joy and gratitude during
                    our son's years at Edison.

                    Running for the LSC was not on my radar before this past
                    winter. I was one of the many parents who felt blindsided
                    by the non-renewal of Mrs. Oberhardt's contract. When it
                    was suggested that feeling surprised or uninformed was a
                    result of being disengaged, I vowed to correct that. I
                    started attending meetings (my husband and I are the
                    authors of the LSCrecaps you might have seen on the
                    Facebook Friends of Edison page), met teachers and parents
                    from other grades, and have gained a tremendous amount of
                    respect for the process involved in local school
                    governance.

                    My training is as a clinical social worker, and I spent
                    over a decade working in the health care field with older
                    adults. While my focus was always clinical, my skill set
                    included facilitating groups, writing and presenting at
                    conferences, advocating for vulnerable individuals and
                    families within larger systems, and acting as a Field

                    I left professional work in 2007 when our oldest child was
                    diagnosed with cancer as a young toddler. After her death I
                    returned to social work, but it didn't quite fit me in the
                    same way. At that point I began blogging and using my
                    growing platform to raise awareness for pediatric cancer.
                    Very unexpectedly, a new career was born.

                    I now work as a freelance writer with a focus on parenting,
                    grief, social justice, healthcare, and education. My work
                    has been featured at ChicagoNow, mom.me, Huffington Post,
                    sheknows, AOL, WGN, CBS2, Fox Business, and on NPR.
                    Recently, I have also added local medical institutions to
                    my client base, focusing on telling the story of healthcare
                    through patient profiles. I maintain an active social media
                    presence of 25K+ Facebook followers for my blog, which has
                    educated me quite a bit on managing conflict and dynamic
                    online debates. I feel quite proud that the little corner
                    of the Internet that I manage has a reputation for being a
                    thriving community that hosts open discussion on
                    controversial topics while remaining respectful and
                    sensitive in tone and content.

                    What I can contribute to the LSC is my enthusiasm, varied
                    communication skills, social media savvy, and experience in
                    creating consensus and working within larger systems. I
                    have grown passionate about gifted education and protective
                    of its need to be valued and funded appropriately.

                    I truly believe that it is possible to maintain
                    confidentiality, something my social work background
                    required extensive knowledge of, while also being
                    transparent and engaging. Those things are not mutually
                    exclusive. I hope to sit on an LSC that works to create
                    bridges to the community and solicits a more active
                    exchange with our dynamic parent community that has so very
                    much to offer. You can help me do that with your vote.

                      Jason Adasiewicz has a daughter in 1st grade and a
                      younger daughter that will be beginning full day
                      preschool next year. Jason's greatest asset that he
                      brings to the school is his work in the arts for the last
                      20 years.  He is a vital member of the Chicago music
                      scene and throughout the year plays over 100 concerts
                      both nationally and internationally, some of which are
                      benefits for nonprofits.  His recordings have made many
                      year end top 10 lists including the infamous NYT Pop and
                      Jazz lists.

                    <p>
                      In addition to performing he has been one of
                      a handful of folks that helped create what the Pitchfork
                      Music Festival is today. His job for 10 years straight
                      was to head the setup and teardown of the 18,000+
                      capacity outdoor festival; everything from climbing the
                      big stages to troubleshooting how to deal with fields of
                      mud created by sudden downpours to organizing perimeter
                      control to keep hipster fence jumpers out.

                    <p>
                      The first thing on Jason's agenda would be to make sure
                      we have an operating PA system, especially for the kid’s
                      rock bands during the winter assembly!  But a broader
                      application of this would be to help organize public
                      meetings and events so that the audience can focus on the
                      activity, not on the logistics of making it run.
